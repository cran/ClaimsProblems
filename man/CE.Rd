\usage{
CE(E, d, name = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{E}{The endowment.}

\item{d}{The vector of claims.}

\item{name}{A logical value.}
}
\value{
The awards vector selected by the CE rule. If name = TRUE, the name of the function (CE) as a character string.
}
\description{
This function returns  the awards vector assigned by the constrained egalitarian rule (CE) rule to a claims problem.
}
\details{
Let \eqn{E\ge 0} be the endowment to be divided and \eqn{d\in \mathcal{R}^n}{d} the vector of claims
with \eqn{d\ge 0} and such that \eqn{\sum_{i=1}^{n} d_i\ge E,\;}{} the sum of claims exceeds the endowment.

Assume that the claims are ordered from small to large, \eqn{0 \le d_1 \le...\le d_n}{%
0 \le d1 \le...\le dn}.
The constrained egalitarian rule coincides with the constrained equal awards rule (CEA) applied to
the problem \eqn{(E, d/2)} if the endowment is less or equal than the half-sum of the claims \eqn{D/2}.
Otherwise, any additional unit is assigned to claimant \eqn{1} until she/he receives the minimum
of the claim and half of \eqn{d_2}{%
d2}. If this minimun is \eqn{d_1}{%
d1}, she/he stops there. If it is not, the next increment is
divided equally between claimants \eqn{1} and \eqn{2} until claimant \eqn{1} receives \eqn{d_1}{%
d1} (in this case she drops out) or they reach \eqn{d_3/2}{%
d3/2}.
If claimant \eqn{1} leaves, claimant \eqn{2} receives any aditional increment until she/he reaches \eqn{d_2}{%
d2} or \eqn{d_3/2}{%
d3/2}. In the case that claimant \eqn{1} and \eqn{2} reach \eqn{d_3/2}{%
d3/2}, any additional unit is divided between claimants \eqn{1}, \eqn{2}, and \eqn{3} until the first one receives \eqn{d_1}{%
d1} or they reach \eqn{d_4/2}{%
d4/2}, and so on.

Therefore:

If \eqn{E \le D/2} then  \eqn{CE(E,d) = CEA(E,d/2)=(\min\{\frac{d_i}{2},\lambda\})_{i\in N}}{CE(E,d)=CEA(E,d/2)=(min\{di/2,\lambda\})} where \eqn{\lambda \ge 0} is chosen so as to achieve balance.

If \eqn{E \ge D/2} then the CE rule assigns to claimant \eqn{i} the maximum of two quantities: the half-claim and the minimum of the claim and a value \eqn{\lambda \ge 0}
 chosen so as to achieve balance.
\deqn{CE_i(E,d)=\max\{\frac{d_i}{2},\min\{d_i,\lambda\}\},\ i=1,\dots,n, \ where \ \sum_{i=1}^{n}	CE_i(E,d)=E.}{CE(E,d) = (max\{ di/2 , min\{di,\lambda\} \}).}

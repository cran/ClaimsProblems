\usage{
CE(E, d, name = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{E}{The endowment.}

\item{d}{The vector of claims.}

\item{name}{A logical value.}
}
\value{
The awards vector selected by the CE rule. If \code{name = TRUE}, the name of the function (CE) as a character string.
}
\description{
This function returns  the awards vector assigned by the constrained egalitarian rule (CE) rule to a claims problem.
}
\details{
Let \eqn{N=\{1,\ldots,n\}} be the set of claimants, \eqn{E\ge 0} the endowment to be divided and \eqn{d\in \mathbb{R}_+^N} the vector of claims
such that \eqn{D=\sum_{i \in N} d_i\ge E}.

Rearrange the claims from small to large, \eqn{0 \le d_1 \le...\le d_n}.
The constrained egalitarian rule (CE) coincides with the constrained equal awards rule (CEA) applied to
the problem \eqn{(E, d/2)} if the endowment is less or equal than the half-sum of the claims, \eqn{D/2}.
Otherwise, any additional unit is assigned to claimant \eqn{1} until she/he receives the minimum
of the claim and half of \eqn{d_2}. If this minimun is \eqn{d_1}, she/he stops there. If it is not, the
next increment is divided equally between claimants \eqn{1} and \eqn{2} until claimant \eqn{1} receives
 \eqn{d_1} (in this case she drops out) or they reach \eqn{d_3/2}.
If claimant \eqn{1} leaves, claimant \eqn{2} receives any additional increment until she/he reaches \eqn{d_2}
or \eqn{d_3/2}. In the case that claimant \eqn{1} and \eqn{2} reach \eqn{d_3/2}, any additional unit is
divided between claimants \eqn{1}, \eqn{2}, and \eqn{3} until the first one receives \eqn{d_1} or they
reach \eqn{d_4/2}, and so on. Therefore, for each \eqn{i\in N},

\deqn{\text{CE}_i(E,d)=\begin{cases}
\min\{\frac{d_i}{2},\lambda\}     & \text{if } E\leq \tfrac{1}{2}D\\[3pt]
\max \bigl\{ \frac{d_i}{2},\min\{d_i,\lambda \} \bigr\} & \text{if }  E \geq \tfrac{1}{2}D
\end{cases},}

where \eqn{\lambda \geq 0} is chosen such that  \eqn{\underset{i\in N}{\sum}	\text{CE}_i(E,d)=E}.

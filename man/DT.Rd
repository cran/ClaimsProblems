\usage{
DT(E, d, name = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{E}{The endowment.}

\item{d}{The vector of claims.}

\item{name}{A logical value.}
}
\value{
The awards vector selected by the DT rule. If \code{name = TRUE}, the name of the function (DT) as a character string.
}
\description{
This function returns the awards vector assigned by the Dominguez-Thomson rule (DT) to a claims problem.
}
\details{
Let \eqn{N=\{1,\ldots,n\}} be the set of claimants, \eqn{E\ge 0} the endowment to be divided and \eqn{d\in \mathbb{R}_+^N} the vector of claims
such that \eqn{\sum_{i \in N} d_i\ge E}.

The truncated claim of claimant \eqn{i\in N} in \eqn{(E,d)} is the minimum of the claim and the endowment:
\deqn{t_i(E,d)=\min\{d_i,E\},\ i=1,\dots,n.}
Let \eqn{t(E,d)=(t_1(E,d),\dots,t_n(E,d))}{t(E,d)=(t1,\dots,tn)} be the vector of truncated claims and \eqn{b(E,d)=\frac{1}{n}t(E,d)}.

Let \eqn{(E^1,d^1)=(E,d)}. For each \eqn{k\ge 2} define:
 \deqn{(E^k,d^k)=\Bigl(E^{k-1}-\sum_{i=1}^n b_i(E^{k-1},d^{k-1}),d^{k-1}-b(E^{k-1},d^{k-1})\Bigr).}

In step 1, the endowment is \eqn{E} and the claims vector is \eqn{d}.
For \eqn{k \ge 2}, the endowment is the remainder once all the claimants have received the amount of the previous steps and the new vector of claims is readjusted accordingly.
Observe that neither the endowment nor each agent's claim ever increases from one step to the next.
This recursive process exhausts \eqn{E} in the limit.

 For each \eqn{(E,d)}, the Dominguez-Thomson rule (DT) assigns the awards vector:
\deqn{\text{DT}(E,d)=\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} b(E^k,d^k).}
